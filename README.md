In this folder we will contain programs that manipulate the grippers of the Baxter robot.

Code will be organized by type of gripper. So far we have the following types:

1. Rethink Standard Fingers:   2 finger electric grippers that come with Baxter.
2. Pivot Approach Camera Mold: Specialized end-effector tool that holds camera molds. Derived from the openhand project. Still uses the standard actuators.
3. Openhand Project:
4. Yale Open Hand Project:
